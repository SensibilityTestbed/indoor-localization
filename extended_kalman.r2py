<Purpose>
  Provides an abstract class for creating an Extended Kalman Filter.
  The EKF is an algorithm than can be used to produce improved estimates 
  of unknown variables by sensor fusion. 

  The EKF has two steps:
    1) The prediction step: predicts how the system state will change,
       and is usually based on a physical model.
    2) The update/correction step: updates the state estimate using
       measurements from various sources.

  To create an EKF, the caller must create a child class of the
  ExtendedKalmanFilter class. Therein must the filter state (specific
  to system model) be defined.
